# node-mcu-heartbeat
hearbeat sensor project
This project was developed at treehacks 2020, its intended use was that a patient or user would wear this device to monitor pulse and send it to Google's Firebase
where then a data set would be used to be able to predict irregular heartbeats before they before they occur.
